# About Me

Hello, I'm Mafruha Shifat, a Senior Lecturer at the School of General Education, Brac University, and a Graduate Student and Teaching Assistant of English at North Dakota State University (NDSU), USA. With a rich academic history including a Master's degree and a Bachelor's (Hons.) degree from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, my journey has led me through various stages of academia, research, and writing.

My key areas of interest include the Bangla and English Languages, Literature, Culture, Comparative and Postcolonial Studies. My most recent ventures dive into Rhetoric, Writing Studies, Intercultural Communication, the globalization of the Bangla language, and Bangladeshi literature. I also actively contribute to advancing outcome-based education and classroom management by utilizing modern pedagogical tools.

I have the privilege of seeing my research published in journals and editions of the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, Bangla Academy, the University of Dhaka, and several other respected publications both in Bangladesh and abroad. My contributions have also made their way to esteemed international conferences like the International Conference on Entangled Englishes in Translocal Spaces, the International Congress of Bengal Studies, the International Conference on Postcolonial Perspective, and the Conference on Foreign Language Education for Sustainable Development Goals.

In my current role at NDSU, I serve as an Editor of OSUN (Open Society University Network) Global Commons and a Writing Consultant at the Center for Writers. I am immensely grateful for the numerous opportunities to grow and learn in these roles.

One of my recent achievements that I am very proud of is the opportunity to participate in a fully-funded, weeklong Writing Workshop Series at the Bard College Institute for Writing & Thinking, New York, facilitated by the OSUN Center for Liberal Arts & Sciences Pedagogy. This incredible opportunity was announced by the NDSU Department of English on March 6th, and I couldn't be more thrilled about it.

Thank you for your support and well-wishes on this journey!
